- What are Window Managers?
- Why Tiling Window Managers are Superior
- How to Get Started With a Tiling WM

* Background

It started changing the theme in the terminal...
Then System Crafting became a hobby, making everything as pretty as possible!

Except for pure vanity, it is:
- A fun way to explore open source!
- Get to know the underlying OS programs
- Configure a personal productivity environment
- Defining a setup that can be reproduced on any system

* Window Manager Flavours

Each window manager falls into a category, one of...

* Why Tiling WMs are Superior (for me)

- Maximize screen utlization - Always use all of the screen
- Simple keybindings - Map shortcuts to program/window actions
- Keyboard driven - Never reach for the mouse again! üòÉ

* How to Get Started With a Tiling WM

This is the code-along part, if you want to try it out.
